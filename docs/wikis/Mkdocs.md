## Plugin configuration

ðŸ†•** Enveloppe 6.1.0** : You can load the settings from the preset using the button "Preset" and selecting `mkdocs` in the selector!

The majority of the settings are optional and help you to manage your repository.

The mandatory settings are :

1. In [[Upload|Upload configuration]] :
   - <u>Folder behavior: </u> YAML frontmatter or Obsidian Path
   - <u>Root folder: </u> `docs`
   - <u>Folder note:</u> `index.md`
   - <u>Excluded files</u> : (_Only if you use the auto-clean up function_) : `docs/assets/js, docs/assets/meta, docs/assets/css, tags.md, graph.md`
1. [[Content|Content's conversion]] :
   - <u>Internal Links : </u> Toggle on
1. Embed files :
   - <u>Transfer attachments:</u>âœ…
   - <u>Default attachment folder:</u> `docs/assets/img`
     The images must be in the `docs/` folder, but you can change the `assets/img` part as you want.
